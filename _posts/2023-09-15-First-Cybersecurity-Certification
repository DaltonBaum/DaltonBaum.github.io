Today I received a Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies Certification. I am grateful to the SANS Institute for providing excellent course material taught by James Lyn. I learned extremely valuable skills during
the course and I look forward to honing these skills as I continue to engage in cybersecurity-related fields.
