Below is my capstone project for my Python Sensor Systems Class at The Colorado School of Mines. It is a basic security system where a pi camera will stream to the VLC Viewer program if motion, sound, or light is detected. The stream functions through the RTSP protocol. I plan to upgrade this project in the future by adding additional sensors or output devices such as an aircraft detection system where the pi logs air traffic.
